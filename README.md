# SICP-exercises

My solutions to the exercises in [Structures and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).

All solutions are written in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) using the [SICP Collections package](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html).
